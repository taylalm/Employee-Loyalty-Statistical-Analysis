# Employee-Loyalty-Statistical-Analysis
Employee Loyalty and Rewards: A Python Statistical Analysis 

## Overview
This project explores the impact of employee loyalty on career progression, compensation, and overall benefits using Python-based statistical methods. The primary goal is to provide insights into whether long-term employees receive tangible rewards, equitable treatment, and career growth opportunities compared to external hires. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and visualization, this study aims to answer key questions about the relationship between loyalty and rewards in the workplace. The analysis was performed using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (e.g., imputed missing insurance data).
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Medical Insurance, Life Insurance).
2. Statistical Analysis
- Conducted t-tests and confidence interval analysis to compare loyal vs. non-loyal employees.
- Analyzed mean gross salaries, benefits, and career progression for different employee categories.
3. Visualization
- Used box plots, histograms, and CI plots to visualize salary distributions and employee metrics.
- Highlighted disparities across departments and career levels.
4. Hypothesis Testing
- Tested whether loyal employees receive significantly better compensation.
- Investigated promotion trends for internally promoted employees versus externally hired employees.

## Key Findings
- Compensation: There is no significant salary difference between long-term employees (LTEs) and non-long-term employees (NLTEs) at higher position levels.
- Career Progression: Internal promotions are less common, with senior positions often filled by external candidates despite internal employees having comparable or greater experience.
- Fairness: Disparities exist in salary allocation across departments, especially at lower career levels.
